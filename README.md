## First task - Iris Flower Classification

To develop a machine learning model for classifying the Iris flower species based on their measurements. 
Here I use A Random Forest Classifier is used to predict the flower species based on the features. 
A Confusion Matrix provides a detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.


## Second task - Unemployement rate in India

I analyzed unemployment in India using two datasets: Unemployment in India (regional data) and Unemployment Rate up to November 2020 (time-series data during COVID-19). 
The task involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to identify key trends

## Third task - Sales Prediction using Python

This task involves predicting sales using advertising data by applying various machine learning models. 
The steps include data preprocessing, outlier detection, visualization, feature selection, train-test splitting, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation of models to identify the best one. The goal is to use the best-performing model to accurately predict sales based on advertising budgets.
